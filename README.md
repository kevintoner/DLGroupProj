# Comparison of Deep Learning Techniques for Stock Price Prediction.

AI702 Deep Learning Course Project submitted by Eman Al suradi, Kevin Toner and Shahina Kunhimon.

## Overview

This project is a comparative study of different deep learning techniques and statistical ARIMA model for predicting
the future stock prices of the Alphabet company.  Univariate probabilistic model ARIMA is used as the baseline. The deep learning
models used are:

1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
2. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) 
3. N-BEATS 
4. Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
